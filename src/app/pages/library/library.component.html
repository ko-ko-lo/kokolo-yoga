  <h1>Find your Yin-Style Yoga Poses in the Library</h1>
  <p>
    Explore a variety of Yin-Style Yoga Poses. Hold each pose for as long as
    feels comfortable, which could be several minutes. Remember to take short
    breaks between poses to tune into your body. Avoid pushing yourself into
    discomfortâ€”listen to your body's signals. If a pose is performed on both
    sides, a note will indicate this.
