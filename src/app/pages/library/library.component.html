    <h1>Find your Yin&#8209;Style Yoga Poses in the Library</h1>
    <p>
      Explore a variety of Yin-Style Yoga Poses. Hold each pose for as long as
      feels comfortable, which could be several minutes. Remember to take short
      breaks between poses to tune into your body. Avoid pushing yourself into
      discomfort, listen to your body's signals. If a pose is performed on both
      sides, a note will indicate this.
